Basic Installation
==================

gnuschool is a website.
It is a collection of directories and text files that contain PHP code.
gnuschool requires PHP, MySQL, and a web server in order to work.

This release is named gnuschool-2.2
It will unpack into a subdirectory named gnuschool-2.2

If you unpack in a path called "/my/full/path/www/"
after you unpack, the new path becomes "/my/full/path/www/gnuschool-2.2/"
The new gnuschool-2.2 directory will have the gnuschool files and subdirectories.

You will need to configure your web server.
If you use Apache, edit 2 lines in the httpd.conf file as follows:
DocumentRoot "/my/full/path/www/"
<Directory "/my/full/path/www/">

Like many other websites, this website uses Javascript and cookies.

To complete the setup you need to access your newly installed gnuschool-2.2 website.
At the main menu, click on "gnuschool Setup", then click on "Setup Steps"
Some of the steps take a few minutes to complete due to database inserts.
To keep the script from timing out, edit php.ini as follows:
max_execution_time = 360

Once the steps are completed you will be done with your gnuschool setup.

Once you have the website up and running, consider improving your website security.

The /gnuschool-2.2/src/up/up.php file contains usernames and passwords.

This file should not be accessable by others.
